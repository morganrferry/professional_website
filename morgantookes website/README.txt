
I didn’t have any school related projects to show on my website, so I tried to have the homepage be an about me section. The homepage covers basic hobbies and interests that I do outside of school. The link to the second page is at the top center so that it can be easily found. The second page is my resume. I marked it up and tried to add some appropriate styling via css. 

I think there is a lot I could have done better! I am not a css major, so most of the topics covered in this class were completely new to me. Before this class I had no idea how to use html or css. I would have liked to make the homepage look better, maybe used a more “professional” looking color scheme and a more balanced page layout. The left and right margins look big and empty to me, I tried to make them smaller but then they weren’t even. I’m not sure what I was doing wrong. I also feel like the css files could have been much more concise. I found myself using the developer tool to copy the individual selectors for each section I was attempting to style. It would have been nice if I took a little more time figuring out how to select more than one section that was being styled the same way.
